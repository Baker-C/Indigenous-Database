# Indigenous-Database
A mock version of the Indigenous Database website from the OIC Learning Collective.

A single database to hold information and sources about indigenous literature, art, music, collectives, and other resources.
### Purpose
This mock version of the website is not for final production. Instead, it serves two main purposes, 
1) Provides a way to plan design decisions and test ideas without making anything perfect for production â€” a sandbox for possible features.
2) Provides a way for me (Baker-C) to expand my skills and knowledge about full-stack web development while still being productive towards a goal.
