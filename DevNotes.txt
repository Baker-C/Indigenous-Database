DEVELOPER NOTES

This file's for both myself and others' sanity ( but mostly my own )

It contains notes on architecture decisions, file structures, 
variables, and coding conventions throughout the app.

It's a good idea to look over this to get a feel for the coding
style before modifying / digging-into the code base.

index.jsx
- entry point
- renders browser and router
- routes to App for root
____________________________________________________________________
App.jsx
- contains routes to pages
- uses the Layout element as a parent for all other components in App
- index element is the home page
____________________________________________________________________
Layout
- parent element for all other components
- easy access to add things like banners across all page views
- root of Outlet nesting for the app structure
____________________________________________________________________
Outlet nesting
- pages are contained in Outlet elements
- each outlet provides a space for any components within
____________________________________________________________________
Component nesting
- components are seperated into smaller components within their file
- try to keep any modifiable content within the main component
- props can be used, but context is preferred for nesting content
____________________________________________________________________
Hooks
- custom hooks are preferred for cleanliness in the component files
____________________________________________________________________
variables.css file
- provides a single place to modify the main css variables
- to be imported into component's css modules
____________________________________________________________________
css modules
- one css module per component
- broken down components are often containers with content inside
- module are named <Component>CSS
____________________________________________________________________
css practices
- declare what container is for in camelcase e.g. ( titleContainer )
- focuses on simple, easy to read naming ( DONT BE CONFUSING )
